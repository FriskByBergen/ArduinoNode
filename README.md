# ArduinoNode

This repo contains various code for running arduino with particle sensors.
So far there are:

* Basic reading of the Sharp particle sensor with a timer
* Reading the Sharp particle sensor and a DHT sensor for temp+humid and send the data with the LLAP protocol
* Basic reading of the Sharp particlew sensor with simple loop
* Python code to read data sent by serial to a computer able to post data to RestDB.io
